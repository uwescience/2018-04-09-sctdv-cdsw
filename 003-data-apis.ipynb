They're only really common when interacting with APIs.) The query in our request above is everything that comes after the question mark; it separates the query from the _path_, which in this case is `/w/api.php`. The query is composed of parameter/value pairs, which have the form `parameter=value` and are separated with ampersands (`&`).\n",

Note that this _query_ is unrelated to the _query string_; if we wanted to edit Wikipedia via the API (which is possible, the syntax is different and outside the scope of this session), we would write `action=edit` instead. The `action` parameter is required in a MediaWiki API call.\n",

If you go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Zen-ben, you'll see that the format of the address to actually view my user page is the same as the requested format here. This is not a coincidence; if you want to try another page, look it up on Wikipedia and switch that name in here instead. (I recommend experimenting!)\n",
