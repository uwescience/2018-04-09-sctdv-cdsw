    "4. What is the longest name in the dataset?\n",
    "5. How many boys' names are also girls' names? How many girls' names are also boys' names?\n",
    "6. How many names are subsets of other names?\n",
    "7. Write a program that will take a name as input and return the number of girls and boys with that name.\n",
    "8. What is the most popular girls' name that is also a boys' name?\n",
    "9. Take a prefix as input and print the number of boys and girls with that prefix (i.e., \"m\" would list babies whose names start with \"m\" and \"ma\" would list babies whose names start with \"ma\", etc)."
